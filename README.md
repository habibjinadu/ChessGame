# ChessGame

This is a work-in-progress chess game with a few twists. Instead of moving like pawns in regular chess, the pawns move like kings, ie, they can move 1 space in any direction
including diagonals. Additionally, after making 3 captures, a player can switch the locations of any two of their pieces on the chessboard (However, this has not been implemented
yet).

In order to run the chess game:

-Download the repository as a .zip file

-Extract the .zip file

-Open and run ChessGame.pde in Processing, available at https://processing.org/

Note that at this point, the program isn't fully finished and you can move any piece to any location.
